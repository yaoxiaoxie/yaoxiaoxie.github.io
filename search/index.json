So even the heavens are celebrating this morning, joining the rest of us at this wonderful commencement ceremony.\nBefore we go any further, graduates, you have an important task to perform because behind you are your parents and guardians. Two or three or four years ago, they drove into Cardigan, dropped you off, helped you get settled and then turned around and drove back out the gates. It was an extraordinary sacrifice for them. They drove down the trail of tears back to an emptier and lonelier house. They did that because the decision about your education, they knew, was about you. It was not about them. That sacrifice and others they made have brought you to this point. But this morning is not just about you. It is also about them, so I hope you will stand up and turn around and give them a great round of applause. Please.\nNow when somebody asks me how the remarks at Cardigan went, I will be able to say they were interrupted by applause. Congratulations, class of 2017. You’ve reached an important milestone. An important stage of your life is behind you. I’m sorry to be the one to tell you it is the easiest stage of your life, but it is in the books. While you’ve been at Cardigan, you have all been a part of an important international community as well. And I think that needs to be particularly recognized.\n[Roberts gave brief remarks in other languages.]\nNow around the country today at colleges, high schools, middle schools, commencement speakers are standing before impatient graduates. And they are almost always saying the same things. They will say that today is a commencement exercise. ‘It is a beginning, not an end. You should look forward.’ And I think that is true enough, however, I think if you’re going to look forward to figure out where you’re going, it’s good to know where you’ve been and to look back as well. And I think if you look back to your first afternoon here at Cardigan, perhaps you will recall that you were lonely. Perhaps you will recall that you were a little scared, a little anxious. And now look at you. You are surrounded by friends that you call brothers, and you are confident in facing the next step in your education.\nIt is worth trying to think why that is so. And when you do, I think you may appreciate that it was because of the support of your classmates in the classroom, on the athletic field and in the dorms. And as far as the confidence goes, I think you will appreciate that it is not because you succeeded at everything you did, but because with the help of your friends, you were not afraid to fail. And if you did fail, you got up and tried again. And if you failed again, you got up and tried again. And if you failed again, it might be time to think about doing something else. But it was not just success, but not being afraid to fail that brought you to this point.\nNow the commencement speakers will typically also wish you good luck and extend good wishes to you.\n通常，毕业典礼的演讲嘉宾都会祝你们好运并送上祝福。\nI will not do that, and I’ll tell you why.\n但我不会这样做，让我来告诉你为什么。\nFrom time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice.\n在未来的很多年中，我希望你被不公正地对待过，唯有如此，你才真正懂得公正的价值。\nI hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty.\n我希望你遭受背叛，唯有如此，你才领悟到忠诚之重要。\nSorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time so that you don’t take friends for granted.\n很抱歉，我会祝福你时常感到孤独，唯有如此，你才不会把良朋益友视为人生中的理所当然。\nI wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either.\n我祝福你人生旅途中时常运气不佳，唯有如此，你才意识到概率和机遇在人生中扮演的角色，\n进而理解你的成功并不完全是命中注定，而别人的失败也不是天经地义。\nAnd when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then, your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship.\n当你失败的时候，时不时地，我希望你的对手会因为你的失败而幸灾乐祸，\n唯有如此，才能让你意识到有风度的竞争精神之重要。\nI hope you’ll be ignored so you know the importance of listening to others,\n我祝福你会被忽视，唯有如此，你才会意识到倾听他人的重要性。\nand I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion.\n我祝福你遭受切肤之痛，唯有如此，才能让你感同身受，从而对别人有同情的理解。\nWhether I wish these things or not, they’re going to happen.\n无论我是否送上这些“祝福”，这些都将在生命中必然发生。\nAnd whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your misfortunes.\n而你能否从中获益，取决于你是否能从你的不幸中领悟到想要传递给你的信息。\nNow commencement speakers are also expected to give some advice. They give grand advice, and they give some useful tips. The most common grand advice they give is for you to be yourself.\n毕业典礼的致辞者习惯给出很多建议。……最常见的建议是“做自己”。\nIt is an odd piece of advice to give people dressed identically, but you should — you should be yourself. But you should understand what that means. Unless you are perfect, it does not mean don’t make any changes. In a certain sense, you should not be yourself. You should try to become something better.\n但你得明白其中真意。如果你并非足够完美，就必须作出改变。这时，你就不能光想着做自己，必须不断自我完善。\nPeople say ‘be yourself’ because they want you to resist the impulse to conform to what others want you to be. But you can’t be yourself if you don’t learn who are, and you can’t learn who you are unless you think about it.\n别人说“做自己”，是希望你抵制按他人意愿随波逐流的冲动。但如果连你都不知道自己要成为什么样的人，是不可能“做自己”的，而如果不思考这些，你也不可能知道自己想成为什么样的人。\nThe Greek philosopher Socrates said, ‘The unexamined life is not worth living.’ And while ‘just do it’ might be a good motto for some things, it’s not a good motto when it’s trying to figure out how to live your life that is before you. And one important clue to living a good life is to not to try to live the good life. The best way to lose the values that are central to who you are is frankly not to think about them at all. So that’s the deep advice.\n希腊哲人苏格拉底说过，“未经自省的人生没有意义。”对某些事情而言，“just do it ”是不错的座右铭，但在你想明白自己想要什么样的人生之前，这个座右铭可不咋滴。\nNow some tips as you get ready to go to your new school. Other the last couple of years, I have gotten to know many of you young men pretty well, and I know you are good guys. But you are also privileged young men. And if you weren’t privileged when you came here, you are privileged now because you have been here. My advice is: Don’t act like it. When you get to your new school, walk up and introduce yourself to the person who is raking the leaves, shoveling the snow or emptying the trash. Learn their name and call them by their name during your time at the school.\nAnother piece of advice: When you pass by people you don’t recognize on the walks, smile, look them in the eye and say hello. The worst thing that will happen is that you will become known as the young man who smiles and says hello, and that is not a bad thing to start with.You’ve been at a school with just boys. Most of you will be going to a school with girls. I have no advice for you. The last bit of advice I’ll give you is very simple, but I think it could make a big difference in your life. Once a week, you should write a note to someone. Not an email. A note on a piece of paper. It will take you exactly 10 minutes. Talk to an adult, let them tell you what a stamp is. You can put the stamp on the envelope. Again, 10 minutes, once a week. I will help you, right now. I will dictate to you the first note you should write. It will say, ‘Dear [fill in the name of a teacher at Cardigan Mountain School].’ Say: ‘I have started at this new school. We are reading [blank] in English. Football or soccer practice is hard, but I’m enjoying it. Thank you for teaching me.’ Put it in an envelope, put a stamp on it and send it. It will mean a great deal to people who — for reasons most of us cannot contemplate — have dedicated themselves to teaching middle school boys. As I said, that will take you exactly 10 minutes a week. By the end of the school year, you will have sent notes to 40 people. Forty people will feel a little more special because you did, and they will think you are very special because of what you did. No one else is going to carry that dividend during your time at school.\nEnough advice. I would like to end by reading some important lyrics. I cited the Greek philosopher Socrates earlier. These lyrics are from the great American philosopher, Bob Dylan. They’re almost 50 years old. He wrote them for his son, Jesse, who he was missing while he was on tour. It lists the hopes that a parent might have for a son and for a daughter. They’re also good goals for a son and a daughter. The wishes are beautiful, they’re timeless. They’re universal. They’re good and true, except for one: It is the wish that gives the song its title and its refrain. That wish is a parent’s lament. It’s not a good wish.\nSo these are the lyrics from Forever Young by Bob Dylan:\nMay God bless you and keep you always\n愿上帝庇佑，护你前路；\nMay your wishes all come true\n愿你美梦均可成真；\nMay you always do for others And let others do for you\n愿你与人为善，相互扶持；\nMay you build a ladder to the stars And climb on every rung\n愿你建成通往群星的天梯；稳妥沿它而上；\nAnd may you stay forever young\n愿你永远年轻；\nMay you grow up to be righteous\n愿你成为正直之人；\nMay you grow up to be true\n愿你成就真实自我；\nMay you always know the truth And see the lights surrounding you\n愿你永远感知真理，看向身边无尽光明；\nMay you always be courageous Stand upright and be strong\n愿你勇敢无惧，坚强可靠；\nAnd may you stay forever young\n愿你永远年轻,拥有纯洁之心；\nMay your hands always be busy May your feet always be swift\n愿你双手永远忙碌，愿你脚步永远轻盈；\nMay you have a strong foundation When the winds of changes shift\n在变故横生之时，愿你根基牢靠；\nMay your heart always be joyful May your song always be sung\n愿你心中永远充满快乐，愿你的歌声永远嘹亮；\nAnd may you stay forever young.\n愿你永远年轻。”\nThank you.\n思考\r人生本就是一场逐光的旅行，但是如飞蛾一般的身体，总是不可避免地遭受各种的磨难与苦痛。\n我们应该学会倾听，珍惜友谊，重视公平，对人忠诚，所谓己所不欲，勿施于人。被强行加诸于自己的痛苦，这终归是只有自己才能品尝的酒，醇香且灼烈。\n","date":"2024-08-19T10:19:28+08:00","image":"https://yaoxiaoxie.github.io/img/face1.jpg","permalink":"https://yaoxiaoxie.github.io/p/%E6%94%B6%E9%9B%86/","title":"愿你成才的路上铺满荆棘"},{"content":"思考\r最近几日尝试在网上寻找了一下实习岗位，怎么说呢，简历也是写的七零八落，总归是不让自己满意。\n但是看下来市场并不是完全无情的，我仍然是有机会的，自己先前的技术栈虽然是零零碎碎，但好坏是可以写出来一点东西，不至于完全虚度光阴。\n接下来打算完善前端的学习，掌握几种基本的框架，在我看来前端就是画框框，画框框嘛，这有什么难的😊\n有的人说要下注下一代互联网技术，我其实也很早就接触到了，不过一直没有深入，以为我认为那种技术很难被社会包容，难以得到认可，不过既然近几日又被我看到了，那就试试吧，毕竟谁也不知道未来会怎么样。\n总结\r还是要继续走下去呀，谁知道未来会变成什么样子，不过既然心里的目标已经变得更加清晰了，那么自己一定可以到达那个地方，加油加油加油！\n","date":"2024-08-01T22:04:11+08:00","image":"https://yaoxiaoxie.github.io/img/face1.jpg","permalink":"https://yaoxiaoxie.github.io/p/offer/","title":"网投实习心得"},{"content":"前言\r在Hugo上写文章的时候，肯定会遇到要插入图片的情况。\n在content/post目录下的markdown文件里引用图片，让网站能正常显示图片。\n这里我们其实有2种选择：\n使用图床：图床其实就是图片存储空间，我们可以把要插入在markdown的图片先上传到图床里，生成图片的永久链接，然后在markdown里引用这个图片链接即可。 优点：文章可以不用修改，直接复制到多个平台，而不用担心图片加载会出问题，因为图片链接是固定永久的。 缺点：免费的图床有上传数量和容量限制，还可能停用。付费的图床嘛，有钱就可以任性。。。\n使用本地图片：直接在markdown里引用本地的图片 优点：免费，图片和文章在一起，不用担心图片丢失 缺点：文章复制到其它平台的时候，对于图片的引用要手工修改，比较繁琐 这篇文章主要讲下如何基于Hugo，在文章对应的markdown文件里引用本地图片。\n操作\r我们先讲下Hugo的一个实现逻辑：\nHugo博客的根目录有一个static目录，这个static目录就是用来存放一些静态文件，比如图片、css、js文件等。\n执行hugo命令的时候，会把static目录下的子目录或文件复制到public目录下。比如我在static下添加了一个img子目录，并且在img子目录放了图片，那执行hugo命令后，就会把static\\img文件的内容拷贝到public\\img里面。\n大家都知道Hugo博客网站展示的其实是public下的内容，因此markdown文章里引用图片的时候，得引用pubic下的图片才可以。\n具体操作非常简单，分2步：\n在static目录下创建img子目录，把markdown要使用的图片放在static\\img目录里。\n在markdown文件里，按照如下格式引用图片(这里假设图片名称叫wechat.png)。这样最终public目录下生成的静态页面就可以引用到public\\img下的图片了。\nmarkdown ![](/img/wechat.png)\n","date":"2024-07-21T09:01:59+08:00","image":"https://yaoxiaoxie.github.io/img/face1.jpg","permalink":"https://yaoxiaoxie.github.io/p/%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2%E6%8F%92%E5%85%A5%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87/","title":"博客插入图片"},{"content":"前言\r本篇博文主要记录本 Hugo 博客从 0 到 1 的简要步骤，但其适用于其他大多数 hugo 博客的搭建流程，仅仅区别于主题的不同。\n具体流程\r准备Hugo文件\r下载 hugo 文件（extended 扩展版）并解压到自定义文件夹（例：我存放的目录为D:\\Hugo\\bin）\n配置环境变量\r在 我的电脑 --\u0026gt;
