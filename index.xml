&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;#####《华盛顿邮报》在评论中说：“罗伯茨大法官本年度最好的作品，不是某个案子的判决书，而是在儿子毕业典礼上的致辞。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rain, somebody said, is like confetti from heaven. So even the heavens are celebrating this morning, joining the rest of us at this wonderful commencement ceremony.&lt;br /&gt;
Before we go any further, graduates, you have an important task to perform because behind you are your parents and guardians. Two or three or four years ago, they drove into Cardigan, dropped you off, helped you get settled and then turned around and drove back out the gates. It was an extraordinary sacrifice for them. They drove down the trail of tears back to an emptier and lonelier house. They did that because the decision about your education, they knew, was about you. It was not about them. That sacrifice and others they made have brought you to this point. But this morning is not just about you. It is also about them, so I hope you will stand up and turn around and give them a great round of applause. Please.&lt;br /&gt;
Now when somebody asks me how the remarks at Cardigan went, I will be able to say they were interrupted by applause. Congratulations, class of 2017. You’ve reached an important milestone. An important stage of your life is behind you. I’m sorry to be the one to tell you it is the easiest stage of your life, but it is in the books. While you’ve been at Cardigan, you have all been a part of an important international community as well. And I think that needs to be particularly recognized.&lt;br /&gt;
[Roberts gave brief remarks in other languages.]&lt;br /&gt;
Now around the country today at colleges, high schools, middle schools, commencement speakers are standing before impatient graduates. And they are almost always saying the same things. They will say that today is a commencement exercise. ‘It is a beginning, not an end. You should look forward.’ And I think that is true enough, however, I think if you’re going to look forward to figure out where you’re going, it’s good to know where you’ve been and to look back as well. And I think if you look back to your first afternoon here at Cardigan, perhaps you will recall that you were lonely. Perhaps you will recall that you were a little scared, a little anxious. And now look at you. You are surrounded by friends that you call brothers, and you are confident in facing the next step in your education.&lt;br /&gt;
It is worth trying to think why that is so. And when you do, I think you may appreciate that it was because of the support of your classmates in the classroom, on the athletic field and in the dorms. And as far as the confidence goes, I think you will appreciate that it is not because you succeeded at everything you did, but because with the help of your friends, you were not afraid to fail. And if you did fail, you got up and tried again. And if you failed again, you got up and tried again. And if you failed again, it might be time to think about doing something else. But it was not just success, but not being afraid to fail that brought you to this point.&lt;br /&gt;
Now the commencement speakers will typically also wish you good luck and extend good wishes to you.&lt;br /&gt;
通常，毕业典礼的演讲嘉宾都会祝你们好运并送上祝福。&lt;br /&gt;
I will not do that, and I’ll tell you why.&lt;br /&gt;
但我不会这样做，让我来告诉你为什么。&lt;br /&gt;
From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice.&lt;br /&gt;
在未来的很多年中，我希望你被不公正地对待过，唯有如此，你才真正懂得公正的价值。&lt;br /&gt;
I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;
我希望你遭受背叛，唯有如此，你才领悟到忠诚之重要。&lt;br /&gt;
Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time so that you don’t take friends for granted.&lt;br /&gt;
很抱歉，我会祝福你时常感到孤独，唯有如此，你才不会把良朋益友视为人生中的理所当然。&lt;br /&gt;
I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either.&lt;br /&gt;
我祝福你人生旅途中时常运气不佳，唯有如此，你才意识到概率和机遇在人生中扮演的角色，&lt;br /&gt;
进而理解你的成功并不完全是命中注定，而别人的失败也不是天经地义。&lt;br /&gt;
And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then, your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship.&lt;br /&gt;
当你失败的时候，时不时地，我希望你的对手会因为你的失败而幸灾乐祸，&lt;br /&gt;
唯有如此，才能让你意识到有风度的竞争精神之重要。&lt;br /&gt;
I hope you’ll be ignored so you know the importance of listening to others,&lt;br /&gt;
我祝福你会被忽视，唯有如此，你才会意识到倾听他人的重要性。&lt;br /&gt;
and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion.&lt;br /&gt;
我祝福你遭受切肤之痛，唯有如此，才能让你感同身受，从而对别人有同情的理解。&lt;br /&gt;
Whether I wish these things or not, they’re going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;
无论我是否送上这些“祝福”，这些都将在生命中必然发生。&lt;br /&gt;
And whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your misfortunes.&lt;br /&gt;
而你能否从中获益，取决于你是否能从你的不幸中领悟到想要传递给你的信息。&lt;br /&gt;
Now commencement speakers are also expected to give some advice. They give grand advice, and they give some useful tips. The most common grand advice they give is for you to be yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
毕业典礼的致辞者习惯给出很多建议。……最常见的建议是“做自己”。&lt;br /&gt;
It is an odd piece of advice to give people dressed identically, but you should — you should be yourself. But you should understand what that means. Unless you are perfect, it does not mean don’t make any changes. In a certain sense, you should not be yourself. You should try to become something better.&lt;br /&gt;
但你得明白其中真意。如果你并非足够完美，就必须作出改变。这时，你就不能光想着做自己，必须不断自我完善。&lt;br /&gt;
People say ‘be yourself’ because they want you to resist the impulse to conform to what others want you to be. But you can’t be yourself if you don’t learn who are, and you can’t learn who you are unless you think about it.&lt;br /&gt;
别人说“做自己”，是希望你抵制按他人意愿随波逐流的冲动。但如果连你都不知道自己要成为什么样的人，是不可能“做自己”的，而如果不思考这些，你也不可能知道自己想成为什么样的人。&lt;br /&gt;
The Greek philosopher Socrates said, ‘The unexamined life is not worth living.’ And while ‘just do it’ might be a good motto for some things, it’s not a good motto when it’s trying to figure out how to live your life that is before you. And one important clue to living a good life is to not to try to live the good life. The best way to lose the values that are central to who you are is frankly not to think about them at all. So that’s the deep advice.&lt;br /&gt;
希腊哲人苏格拉底说过，“未经自省的人生没有意义。”对某些事情而言，“just do it ”是不错的座右铭，但在你想明白自己想要什么样的人生之前，这个座右铭可不咋滴。&lt;br /&gt;
Now some tips as you get ready to go to your new school. Other the last couple of years, I have gotten to know many of you young men pretty well, and I know you are good guys. But you are also privileged young men. And if you weren’t privileged when you came here, you are privileged now because you have been here. My advice is: Don’t act like it. When you get to your new school, walk up and introduce yourself to the person who is raking the leaves, shoveling the snow or emptying the trash. Learn their name and call them by their name during your time at the school.&lt;br /&gt;
Another piece of advice: When you pass by people you don’t recognize on the walks, smile, look them in the eye and say hello. The worst thing that will happen is that you will become known as the young man who smiles and says hello, and that is not a bad thing to start with.You’ve been at a school with just boys. Most of you will be going to a school with girls. I have no advice for you. The last bit of advice I’ll give you is very simple, but I think it could make a big difference in your life. Once a week, you should write a note to someone. Not an email. A note on a piece of paper. It will take you exactly 10 minutes. Talk to an adult, let them tell you what a stamp is. You can put the stamp on the envelope. Again, 10 minutes, once a week. I will help you, right now. I will dictate to you the first note you should write. It will say, ‘Dear [fill in the name of a teacher at Cardigan Mountain School].’ Say: ‘I have started at this new school. We are reading [blank] in English. Football or soccer practice is hard, but I’m enjoying it. Thank you for teaching me.’ Put it in an envelope, put a stamp on it and send it. It will mean a great deal to people who — for reasons most of us cannot contemplate — have dedicated themselves to teaching middle school boys. As I said, that will take you exactly 10 minutes a week. By the end of the school year, you will have sent notes to 40 people. Forty people will feel a little more special because you did, and they will think you are very special because of what you did. No one else is going to carry that dividend during your time at school.&lt;br /&gt;
Enough advice. I would like to end by reading some important lyrics. I cited the Greek philosopher Socrates earlier. These lyrics are from the great American philosopher, Bob Dylan. They’re almost 50 years old. He wrote them for his son, Jesse, who he was missing while he was on tour. It lists the hopes that a parent might have for a son and for a daughter. They’re also good goals for a son and a daughter. The wishes are beautiful, they’re timeless. They’re universal. They’re good and true, except for one: It is the wish that gives the song its title and its refrain. That wish is a parent’s lament. It’s not a good wish.&lt;br /&gt;
So these are the lyrics from Forever Young by Bob Dylan:&lt;br /&gt;
May God bless you and keep you always&lt;br /&gt;
愿上帝庇佑，护你前路；&lt;br /&gt;
May your wishes all come true&lt;br&gt;
愿你美梦均可成真；&lt;br /&gt;
May you always do for others And let others do for you&lt;br /&gt;
愿你与人为善，相互扶持；&lt;br /&gt;
May you build a ladder to the stars And climb on every rung&lt;br /&gt;
愿你建成通往群星的天梯；稳妥沿它而上；&lt;br /&gt;
And may you stay forever young&lt;br /&gt;
愿你永远年轻；&lt;br /&gt;
May you grow up to be righteous&lt;br /&gt;
愿你成为正直之人；&lt;br /&gt;
May you grow up to be true&lt;br /&gt;
愿你成就真实自我；&lt;br /&gt;
May you always know the truth And see the lights surrounding you&lt;br /&gt;
愿你永远感知真理，看向身边无尽光明；&lt;br /&gt;
May you always be courageous Stand upright and be strong&lt;br /&gt;
愿你勇敢无惧，坚强可靠；&lt;br /&gt;
And may you stay forever young&lt;br /&gt;
愿你永远年轻,拥有纯洁之心；&lt;br /&gt;
May your hands always be busy May your feet always be swift&lt;br /&gt;
愿你双手永远忙碌，愿你脚步永远轻盈；&lt;br /&gt;
May you have a strong foundation When the winds of changes shift&lt;br /&gt;
在变故横生之时，愿你根基牢靠；&lt;br /&gt;
May your heart always be joyful May your song always be sung&lt;br /&gt;
愿你心中永远充满快乐，愿你的歌声永远嘹亮；&lt;br /&gt;
And may you stay forever young.&lt;br /&gt;
愿你永远年轻。”&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;思考&#34;&gt;思考
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;人生本就是一场逐光的旅行，但是如飞蛾一般的身体，总是不可避免地遭受各种的磨难与苦痛。&lt;br /&gt;
我们应该学会倾听，珍惜友谊，重视公平，对人忠诚，所谓己所不欲，勿施于人。被强行加诸于自己的痛苦，这终归是只有自己才能品尝的酒，醇香且灼烈。&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;最近几日尝试在网上寻找了一下实习岗位，怎么说呢，简历也是写的七零八落，总归是不让自己满意。&lt;br /&gt;
但是看下来市场并不是完全无情的，我仍然是有机会的，自己先前的技术栈虽然是零零碎碎，但好坏是可以写出来一点东西，不至于完全虚度光阴。&lt;br /&gt;
接下来打算完善前端的学习，掌握几种基本的框架，在我看来前端就是画框框，画框框嘛，这有什么难的😊&lt;br /&gt;
有的人说要下注下一代互联网技术，我其实也很早就接触到了，不过一直没有深入，以为我认为那种技术很难被社会包容，难以得到认可，不过既然近几日又被我看到了，那就试试吧，毕竟谁也不知道未来会怎么样。&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;总结&#34;&gt;总结
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;还是要继续走下去呀，谁知道未来会变成什么样子，不过既然心里的目标已经变得更加清晰了，那么自己一定可以到达那个地方，加油加油加油！&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://yaoxiaoxie.github.io/img/face1.jpg" alt="Featured image of post 博客插入图片" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;前言&#34;&gt;前言
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;在Hugo上写文章的时候，肯定会遇到要插入图片的情况。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在&lt;mark&gt;content/post&lt;/mark&gt;目录下的markdown文件里引用图片，让网站能正常显示图片。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里我们其实有2种选择：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;使用图床：图床其实就是图片存储空间，我们可以把要插入在markdown的图片先上传到图床里，生成图片的永久链接，然后在markdown里引用这个图片链接即可。
优点：文章可以不用修改，直接复制到多个平台，而不用担心图片加载会出问题，因为图片链接是固定永久的。
缺点：免费的图床有上传数量和容量限制，还可能停用。付费的图床嘛，有钱就可以任性。。。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;使用本地图片：直接在markdown里引用本地的图片
优点：免费，图片和文章在一起，不用担心图片丢失
缺点：文章复制到其它平台的时候，对于图片的引用要手工修改，比较繁琐
这篇文章主要讲下如何基于Hugo，在文章对应的markdown文件里引用本地图片。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;操作&#34;&gt;操作
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;我们先讲下Hugo的一个实现逻辑：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo博客的根目录有一个static目录，这个static目录就是用来存放一些静态文件，比如图片、css、js文件等。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;执行hugo命令的时候，会把static目录下的子目录或文件复制到public目录下。比如我在static下添加了一个img子目录，并且在img子目录放了图片，那执行hugo命令后，就会把static\img文件的内容拷贝到public\img里面。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大家都知道Hugo博客网站展示的其实是public下的内容，因此markdown文章里引用图片的时候，得引用pubic下的图片才可以。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;具体操作非常简单，分2步：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在static目录下创建img子目录，把markdown要使用的图片放在static\img目录里。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在markdown文件里，按照如下格式引用图片(这里假设图片名称叫wechat.png)。这样最终public目录下生成的静态页面就可以引用到public\img下的图片了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=MistyRose&gt;markdown
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;![](/img/wechat.png&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://yaoxiaoxie.github.io/img/face1.jpg" alt="Featured image of post 博客搭建过程" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;前言&#34;&gt;前言
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;本篇博文主要记录本 Hugo 博客从 0 到 1 的简要步骤，但其适用于其他大多数 hugo 博客的搭建流程，仅仅区别于主题的不同。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;具体流程&#34;&gt;具体流程
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;准备hugo文件&#34;&gt;准备Hugo文件
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;下载 hugo 文件（extended 扩展版）并解压到自定义文件夹（例：我存放的目录为&lt;code&gt;D:\Hugo\bin&lt;/code&gt;）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;配置环境变量&#34;&gt;配置环境变量
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;在 &lt;code&gt;我的电脑 --&amp;gt; 属性 --&amp;gt; 高级系统设置 --&amp;gt; 环境变量 --&amp;gt; 系统变量 --&amp;gt; Path&lt;/code&gt; 中增加一条&lt;code&gt;D:\Hugo\bin&lt;/code&gt;，即解压后的 &lt;code&gt;hugo.exe &lt;/code&gt;文件存放的目录。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;D:\Hugo\bin 修改为自己对应文件位置路径&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;检查版本&#34;&gt;检查版本
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;打开 cmd 终端执行以下命令查看是否安装成功（是否输出 Hugo 版本信息）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;hugo version
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;生成博客&#34;&gt;生成博客
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;生成博客-1&#34;&gt;生成博客
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;打开命令窗口，进入&lt;code&gt;D:\Hugo\Sites&lt;/code&gt;文件夹（生成站点的文件夹，自定义），输入命令&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;hugo new site myblog
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;命令执行完成之后在D:\Hugo\Sites\myblog文件夹下会自动生成博客需要的文件&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;安装主题&#34;&gt;安装主题
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugo 主题网站&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;执行以下命令完成 meme 主题的安装。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; myblog
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git init
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git submodule add --depth &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; https://github.com/reuixiy/hugo-theme.git themes/hugo-theme
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

        <title>这一路の经过~</title>

        <pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 06:00:00 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://yaoxiaoxie.github.io/p/%E5%BF%83%E5%BE%97/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://yaoxiaoxie.github.io/img/face1.jpg" alt="Featured image of post 这一路の经过~" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;1辗转反侧&#34;&gt;1.辗转反侧
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;11-相见&#34;&gt;1.1 相见
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;最开始了解到一个个人博客，大概是看到了某个人的作品，当时惊叹于这种对当时的我来说是一种巨大打击的作品，我接触互联网还是10年左右，当时各种各样的东西在网络上方兴未已。要我说，当时的互联网，还是一个人人都可以得到他人近乎无私帮助的时代。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;12-历程&#34;&gt;1.2 历程
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;好了，既然了解了，那就开干吧，但是当时还没有这种意识，当我真正有一个成熟的想法时，这已经是十年之后了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;13-准备&#34;&gt;1.3 准备
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;最开始，我还相信互联网依旧是可以随便找到自己所需要的东西的时代，当我再次满怀期待的开始着手进行，我这才发现，这互联网，已经不再是记忆中那般摸样了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;2开始&#34;&gt;2.开始
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;21-类型之分&#34;&gt;2.1 类型之分
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;市面上常规的博客大致分为静态与动态两个大类，其中动态依托于云服务器运行，这样再搭配宝塔面板等生成工具可以非常方便的完成个人博客的搭建，这可以说是近乎完美的，但是这种方法每年都需要向运营商支付高昂的费用。因此，这段然不在我的考虑范围之内，我选择了搭建静态博客，这可以为我省下大量的费用，近乎可以说是零成本的，但缺点就是，这个环节中出现某些问题，往往是致命的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;22-做&#34;&gt;2.2 做
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;既然是自己的梦想，那就不要耽搁了，于是我开始在网上查阅各种资料来进行准备，最终选择了hexo框架来进行搭建，但我在最开始就遇到了困难，bash、node.js这两个工具让我焦头烂耳，是的，在最初安装时工具的各方面调试就让我难以招架，甚至工作一度因为此种原因而搁置***
如今，当我已经完成之后，回首望去，自己对当时的问题感到十分不解，细细想来，当时应该是环境变量配置出现问题，当时各种教程给的方法众说纷纭，自己对未知的恐惧一度让种子死亡在泥土里。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;23-末&#34;&gt;2.3 末
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;当然，现在看来，自己是走了很多捷径才能够完成，其中许多机理，我在书写这篇文章时依旧不是太明白，不过，这些问题还是被克服了，总之结果是美好的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;3&#34;&gt;3.😊❤️
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;在这个过程中，我虽然遇到了一些错误的指引，不过最终还是可以找到正确的方案，在此期间，相当量的教程给予了我很大的帮助，或许，那种乐于分享的火焰依然有人传承下去。我很感谢互联网的存在，这让我看到了广阔的天地（虽然我大多数时间都没干正事），我想大多数如我般的穷人，他们可以一生都会处于一种跟着短视频之类废料行舟的状态，我认为人如果能把自己的空闲时间挪用一小部分在学习上，虽不可谈会有多大的建树，但这一定是对自己及家庭乃至整个社会都有益的事。&lt;br /&gt;
在最后，我要再次感谢那些留些路标的人，他们为我的沙漠行舟提供了巨大的助力，我将会在接下来的日子里将我遇到的困难和解决方法一一书写以供后来者参考，在此，再次感谢那些为我提供帮助的人，因为有你们，这火焰才能越燃越旺。&lt;/p&gt;

用撼动一座岩石的力量&lt;br /&gt;
生长&lt;br /&gt;
春雨和冰霜同样&lt;br /&gt;
只能带来一段故事&lt;br /&gt;
沉睡的是这个世界的爱意&lt;br /&gt;
如果不能睁开眼睛&lt;br /&gt;
就用每一只手触摸你&lt;br /&gt;
前世冰冷&lt;br /&gt;
来世温暖&lt;br /&gt;
只在此生纠缠不清&lt;br /&gt;
谁也无法把两种根连在一起&lt;br /&gt;
这是我们的命运&lt;br /&gt;
哪怕是死后&lt;br /&gt;
或者被山羊连根拔起&lt;br /&gt;
我的梦在云云俗口中碎成渣&lt;br /&gt;
也依然享有最温暖的光阴&lt;br /&gt;
在下一个春季&lt;br /&gt;
我确信&lt;br /&gt;
我的草籽&lt;br /&gt;
只需一点山风的沐浴&lt;br /&gt;
就能所向披靡
&lt;/center&gt;
